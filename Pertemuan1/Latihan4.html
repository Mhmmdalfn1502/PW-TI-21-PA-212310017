    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages to Lear in 2022</h1>
    <p>
      There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now.
      The <a class="Redfont">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> projects 21
      percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is more than
      four times the average for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual
      pay for a software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times
      the median pay for all U.S. workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles,
      companies, and types of software require knowing and understanding
      different programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple
      languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be a
      daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior
      programming experience.

      at Northeastern University is specifically designed for students who want
      to transition into computer science from another field of study.

      “Our aim is to transport students from a variety of dif erent backgrounds
      and have them come out as software engineers,” says Ian Gorton, PhD and
      director of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern
      University—Seattle. “We focus on math, programming, and a variety of
      computer science and engineering concepts.”

      Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills,
      it helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the
      most popular programming languages of 2020 based on the number of job
      postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average annual salary for
      those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.
